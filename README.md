### Overview: 
The analysis conducted on Tesla's stock price incorporates both historical performance and forecasted values, highlighting key metrics for understanding market trends. By using Python and libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib, we created a comprehensive dataset that includes actual closing prices and predictive forecasts based on a selected period. This analysis provides valuable insights into stock volatility and performance, allowing investors to make informed decisions.

### Key Components of the Analysis:
- Data Collection: The process began by gathering historical stock data, including open, high, low, close prices, and volume. Adjusted closing prices were used for accuracy in analysis.
- Calculating Metrics: We calculated key performance indicators, such as the High-Low Percentage (HL_Perc) to assess volatility and the Close-Open Percentage (CO_Perc) to understand daily performance changes.
- Forecasting: Predictions were generated for future stock prices, which were then integrated into the dataset for comparative analysis against actual prices.
- Visualization: A plot was created to visually compare actual prices against forecasted values, enhancing the analysis through graphical representation.

### Conclusion:
The Tesla stock prediction project provided valuable insights into the company's historical performance and potential future trends. By utilizing various data analysis and visualization techniques, the project aimed to equip investors and analysts with tools to make informed decisions based on Tesla's stock movements.
